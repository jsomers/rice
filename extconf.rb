# To allow Rice to be installed on non-system installs of Ruby (say the user has
# 1.8.7 and 1.9.0 installed), the rice gem uses the extconf version of deployment
# rather than configure. This file will get the appropriate values from CONFIG
# for the Ruby that this library is being installed into and generate
# the proper arguments to ./configure.
#
# With this, installing on any of the Ruby versions installed on a machine is as
# easy as /path/to/the/gem install rice.
#
# This isn't actually an extconf.rb file, all it needs to do is create a Makefile
# for gem to continue 'make'-ing. It needs to be named 'extconf.rb' to fit Rubygem's
# expectations

Unfortunately Rice does not work against a Ruby without any shared libraries.
You'll need to rebuild Ruby with --enable-shared to use this library.

If you're on rvm:   rvm reinstall [version] -- --enable-shared
If you're on rbenv: CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" rbenv install [version]
If this is a host environment like Heroku you'll need to contact their support.
